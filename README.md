# Restaurant Management System

This is a simple **Restaurant Management System** built using **React**. The application allows users to add, view, update, and delete restaurant details such as name, email, address, and rating. The backend is powered by **JSON Server** to simulate a REST API, making it easy to manage data without setting up a real database.

## Features

- **Add Restaurant**: Allows users to add a new restaurant to the system.
- **View Restaurant List**: Displays a list of all restaurants with their details.
- **Update Restaurant**: Enables users to update the details of a specific restaurant.
- **Delete Restaurant**: Allows users to delete a restaurant from the system.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, React-Bootstrap, React Router
- **Backend**: JSON Server (for mock API)
- **Styling**: Bootstrap for responsive design and styling
- **Icons**: FontAwesome for icons

## Folder Structure

The project folder structure is as follows:

```
/my-project
├── /public
│   └── index.html
├── /src
│   ├── /components
│   │   ├── RestaurantCreate.js
│   │   ├── RestaurantList.js
│   │   └── RestaurantUpdate.js
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── logo.svg
│   └── reportWebVitals.js
├── /db
│   └── db.json
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

- **`/src`**: Contains all the React components and main application files.
- **`/db`**: Contains the mock database (`db.json`) used for the API.
- **`/public`**: Contains the static files like `index.html`.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project dependencies and scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server (using JSON Server):

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

5. Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Scripts

- **start**: Runs the application in development mode.
- **build**: Builds the application for production.
- **test**: Runs tests (if any).
- **eject**: Ejects the configuration files (advanced usage).
- **server**: Starts the mock backend server using JSON Server.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple and effective way to manage restaurant information, and it demonstrates the power of **React** for building dynamic web applications. It also shows how easy it is to simulate a backend with **JSON Server** for rapid development.
